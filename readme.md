# TUUDUU - a small and simple todo list application

### TODO:

- hide the delete button when creating a new todo
- show a loading overlay when loading
- show a message when there is no todo
- store the theme setting in the local storage
- finalize css / theme
- integrate a warning on delete
- check the validation (currently on firefox the form validation errors are only shown once)
